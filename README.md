### Summary

*   Development Status: version 1.2.3  

*   Environment: Win32 (MS Windows 2000/XP)  

*   Intended Audience: Epidemiologists, geneticists  

*   Operating System: MS Windows 2000 & XP  

*   Programming Language: Fortran 90  

*   Topic: Statistical genetics  

### Description of project:

Chaplin is a software program for identifying specific haplotypes or haplotype features that are associated with disease using genotype data from a case-control study. The program utilizes statistical methodology initially developed in Epstein and Satten (2003) and explored further in Satten and Epstein (2004). For a thorough description of the statistical methodology, please review these papers (which are available for download below).  

Chaplin is a Win32 application written in FORTRAN 90 using IMSL numerical routines and has been tested on both Windows XP and 2000 machines. The software has not been tested on earlier versions of the Windows OS or on UNIX platforms but it is unlikely that Chaplin will perform correctly on these systems.
